            <p>Hello everyone, I'm Sanket Shinde, I am an Engineering Undergraduate specializing in Information
                Technology at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I have consistently demonstrated academic
                excellence, achieving a perfect SGPA of 10.00 in my first semester and 9.50 in the second. Beyond
                academics, I have a strong passion for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and I am actively honing my
                skills in web development. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about exploring the fields of Artificial
                Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML).</p>
